My crew awaits there as we make repairs and forage for supplies,我的船员在那里等待，我们正在修理船只并搜寻补给

So you’re a smuggler then?,所以你是走私者？

Why 'smuggler' is such a vulgar term,为什么‘走私者’这个词如此粗俗

As I said: ‘tis nothing but a lover’s quarrel!,正如我所说：这不过是情人间的争吵！

I assure you,我保证
"I am certain, if you intercede on my behalf to the Queen, and make sure to tell her I’m terribly regretful, she will see reason and let me be on my merry way",如果你为我向女王求情，并确保告诉她我非常后悔，她会理智行事，让我平安离开
I'm not sure I believe you,我不确定我是否相信你
Because Iago zha Droma is the finest captain to ever grace the Outer Isles with his sails,因为伊阿哥·卓玛是外群岛有史以来最优秀的船长
"Besides, if you find another captain, brave or stupid enough to venture out to sea in these dire times, I shall dance on my mother’s grave!",而且，如果你能找到另一个足够勇敢或愚蠢，敢于在这危难时刻出海的船长，我将在我母亲的坟头上跳舞！

Horror stalks the depths around Idra,恐怖在伊德拉的深处徘徊。
I have seen it with my own eyes!,我亲眼见过它！
I know,我知道。
It sunk our ship as we came in!,当我们靠近时，它沉没了我们的船只！
Then you know what I speak of. ‘The Terror of Idra’,那么你也知道我说的是什么。‘伊德拉的恐怖’。

It fell upon us as well when we passed Sylo’s Teeth,当我们经过西洛之牙时，它也降临在我们身上。
Many of my men were swept off deck and large gouges were torn from the sides of my beautiful ship,许多我的士兵被卷下甲板，我的美丽船只的两侧被撕开了巨大的缺口。
What happened?,发生了什么？
Were it not for the grit of my crew and the blessed ship-wrights who shaped the magnificent hull of the ‘Oruda’ we would have met our end as you did,要不是我的船员们坚韧不拔，以及那些神圣的造船匠们精心打造了‘奥达’这艘壮丽的船体，我们早就和你们一样遭遇了同样的命运。
Instead we were able to slip from its grasp and make our way past the reefs and into shallower waters where the behemoth could not follow,相反，我们设法摆脱了它的控制，绕过了暗礁，进入了更深的水域，那里巨兽无法跟随。
What is the nature of this behemoth?,这个巨兽的本质是什么？
And where is your ship now?,而你现在的小船在哪里？

An interloper,一个闯入者
"Stepping between the corpses, you spot a man who you immediately recognize as the Zephyr’s first mate",踩着尸体之间，你发现了一名你立刻认出是“西风号”大副的男子
"Around his neck, a sturdy chain glimmers and you carefully fish out a strange octagonal amulet, richly filigreed and with the navigational roset of the Nautical Guild carved on it",他的脖子上挂着一条坚固的链子，你小心翼翼地从他身上取下一块精美的八边形护身符，雕刻着航海公会的航海玫瑰图案

"The weathered box crumbles as you touch it, revealing an ancient knife of exquisitely carved greenish stone",你触碰那个破旧的盒子时，它碎裂开来，露出一把精雕细琢的绿石古刀。
With trembling hands you pick it up and for a moment the air around you seems to become charged with eldritch energies,你颤抖着手拿起它，周围的空间似乎充满了神秘的力量。
Sounds die down and your nostrils fill with the metallic tinge of ozone,声音渐渐平息，你的鼻孔里充满了臭氧的金属味道。
No doubt this is the object Mathias the lighthousekeeper asked you to retrieve,毫无疑问，这正是灯塔看守人马修斯让你取回的物品。
No doubt the blade is an object of strange and ancient magics,毫无疑问，这把刀是奇异而古老的魔法之物。

"Driina slowly walks around the slab, taking in the strange sight",德里娜缓缓绕着石板走动，仔细观察着这奇怪的景象
There is ritual at work here,这里正在进行某种仪式
Though nothing like the Imperial rites of Sepulcation,虽然与帝国的葬礼仪式完全不同
This is something different,这是完全不同的东西
There is a sense of technicality to it,这种仪式显得非常技术化
Like children observing a parent practicing some complex craft and trying to emulate it,像是孩子们在观察父母练习某种复杂的工艺，并试图模仿
She shudders,她颤抖着
It terrifies me,这让我感到恐惧

You find several lesions on them - no doubt caused by the strange instruments that surround them,你发现他们的身上有几个病灶——毫无疑问是那些奇怪的器具造成的
"As to the purpose of the cuts, you have no idea",关于这些切割的目的，你毫无头绪
As you look more closely it becomes clear to you that these are not the incisions that are commonly associated with the removal of organs for embalming,越仔细观察，你越清楚这些不是通常用于器官取出的防腐处理的切割
"In fact, from what you can tell, the corpses’ organs are still intact",实际上，从你所能看到的，这些尸体的器官似乎仍然完好无损
This ritual seems to have served another purpose,这种仪式似乎还有其他目的
"Though what, you cannot possibly guess",但具体是什么，你完全猜不到
Carefully brushing away dust and cobwebs you survey the oddly shaped instruments,轻轻拂去尘土和蛛网，你审视着这些奇怪形状的器具
"Their shapes vary from small blades to hooks and other, stranger forms",它们的形状从小小的刀片到钩子，再到其他更奇怪的形态
You have no idea as to their purpose,你完全不知道它们的具体用途
"As you stand there pondering the strange scene before you, your eyes fall on a small wooden box",当你在那里沉思这奇怪的场景时，你的目光落在一个小木盒上
Examine the box,检查木盒
Even a cursory examination reveals that these instruments were likely used on the corpses but as far as you can tell they do not seem to be embalming tools,即使是粗略的检查也表明这些乐器可能是用于尸体上的，但从你所能看到的来看，它们似乎不是防腐工具。
Instead they seem more like primitive imitations of the tools Imperial surgeons use,相反，它们看起来更像是帝国外科医生使用的工具的原始模仿品。
An Ancient Corpse,一具古老的尸体
Two desiccated corpses lie carefully placed on a carved stone slab,两具干瘪的尸体被仔细地放在雕刻的石板上。
There is a deliberateness in their arrangement that gives the strong impression of forgotten secrets and ancient rituals,它们的排列方式显示出一种被遗忘的秘密和古老仪式的强烈暗示。
Scattered about the corpses are several strange looking metal instruments,尸体周围散落着几件奇怪的金属工具。
Examine the corpses,检查尸体。
"Driina, what do you make of this?",Driina，你对此有什么看法？
Examine the instruments,检查这些工具。
Sprawled on the ground ahead of you lies the mangled body of a man,你面前地上躺着一个被严重扭曲的男子尸体。
Stacked high against the walls behind the poor fellow are crates of goods and you have a feeling you've stumbled upon a smuggler's hideout,贫穷的家伙身后，高高的堆着装有货物的箱子，你有一种闯入了走私者藏身之处的感觉。
One that has seen fairly recent use,一个近期被使用过的藏身之处。
You enter into the larger chamber ahead and the temperature drops noticeably,你进入前方更大的房间，温度明显下降。
"As the swirling dust and ghostly vapors subside, you make out the intimidating form of an ancient, carved monolith",当旋涡状的尘埃和鬼魅般的雾气消散后，你认出了那令人畏惧的古老雕刻巨石。
"Painted on its face, you immediately recognize the crude spiral sign you saw on the standing stones above ground",巨石的表面，你立刻认出了在地面上竖立的石碑上看到的粗糙螺旋符号。
"Painted on its face, you can make out the crude shape of a red spiral",巨石的表面，你勉强辨认出一个粗糙的红色螺旋形状。
"Carefully arranged before the monolith lies two diminutive, desiccated corpses and along the edges of the chamber stand strange urns of unknown design",在巨石前，仔细排列着两具小型、干瘪的尸体，房间边缘立着一些设计奇特的陶罐。
The chamber has an aura of age beyond comprehension and your head begins to spin as you realize you may be the first to set foot in it for millennia,这个房间有一种难以理解的古老气息，你开始头晕，意识到自己可能是数千年间第一个踏入这里的人。
We shouldn't be here,我们不该在这里。
Kat whispers behind you,Kat 在你身后低语。
The Tunnel,迷宫
Creeping through the narrow and cobweb covered tunnel it occurs to you that you’re likely the first to use it in decades,穿过狭窄且布满蜘蛛网的隧道，你意识到这可能是几十年来第一次有人使用它
"It appears that neither the smugglers, nor whoever lies on the other end of the tunnel, knew of its existence",看来，无论是走私者，还是隧道另一端的那个人，都不知道它的存在
The wall ahead is no doubt another door and you put your shoulder to it,前方的墙壁无疑是一扇门，你用肩膀顶了上去
"Expecting the massive slab of rock to be heavy, you're surprised to find it easily swings open and you nearly stumble into the room ahead",你本以为这巨大的岩石门会很沉重，没想到它竟然轻易地开了，你差点绊倒在前面的房间里
"It occurs to you that given the doors clever design, there would likely have been no way of finding this door from the other side",你意识到，考虑到这扇门的设计巧妙，从另一端是根本找不到它的

With a small troupe of hungry and fearful guardsmen I was able to fight my way to the square and slay many of their numbers,带着一小队饥饿而恐惧的卫兵，我得以冲到广场并杀死了他们很多人。

And what did you have in mind?,你有什么打算？

Shall we make a tale worthy of the skalds?,我们要创作一个足以让吟游诗人传唱的故事吗？
Let's do it!,我们就做吧！
I'll do it but we don't need company,我会去做，但不需要同伴
That the situation is dire but not hopeless,局面危急但并非绝境

The smell of cooking food fills the camp and mixes with the sounds of cheers and blessings coming from the ragged lot of starving refugees,烹饪食物的香味弥漫在营地中，与那些衣衫褴褛的饥饿难民发出的欢呼和祝福声交织在一起
You enter the makeshift office of Markus to tell him the good news and find him agitatedly pacing back and forth,你走进马克乌斯临时的办公室，告诉他这个好消息，却发现他焦急地来回踱步

"Iben, tell {PLAYER} what you just told me!",伊本，告诉马库斯你刚才告诉我的！
The recent excitement has evidently taken more than expected out of the plump man and Markus slumps heavily into his chair,最近的兴奋显然超出了这个丰满男子的预期，马克乌斯重重地瘫坐在椅子上
He gestures absent-mindedly to an unlit corner of the room as he catches his breath,他喘着气，不自觉地朝房间的一个未点亮的角落做了个手势
That will also work!,这样也行！
There is much to do here in camp to get those able to bear arms ready to storm the gate!,在营地里，还有很多事情要做，让那些能够拿起武器的人做好攻城的准备！

Then woe to those who stand against us!,那些与我们为敌的人将自寻死路！

There are two gates in the city,这座城市有两个城门。
"The main gate to the north and one to the south, leading to the harbor",北边是主城门，南边有一个通往港口的城门。
Both are heavy portcullises and the only way to raise them is to find the nearby mechanism that operates them,两个城门都是重弩门，唯一的办法是找到附近的装置来操作它们。
Survivors may be hiding in barricaded houses and perhaps cellars!,幸存者们可能躲在了加固的房屋里，甚至地下室里！

"However, were it not for the fact that I would have a mutiny on my hands, I would have kept them in the camp for now",据我的士兵报告，内城的掠夺者似乎已被消灭或赶走。
Things are much more dangerous here in Horryn than they realize,然而，他们中被称为‘父亲’的家伙仍然占据着港口西南角的要塞。
"As far as my men report, the Reavers in the inner city seem to have been slain or driven off",他带着剩余的同伙把自己困在里面，但这还不是最糟糕的。
"However, the one they call… ‘Father’ still occupies the keep in the south-west corner of the harbor",报道说，有几十名平民被掠夺者活捉，并被带到了要塞。
He’s barricaded himself inside with the remainder of his pack and that’s not the worst of it,报道说，有几十名平民被掠夺者活捉，并被带到了要塞。

I dread even contemplating what they are going through if they are still alive,我甚至不敢想象如果他们还活着，他们正经历着什么
"We must purge Horryn of this remaining ‘infestation’ and, if the Holy Tombs will it, rescue the captives",我们必须清除霍林城中剩余的‘寄生虫’，如果圣墓愿意的话，还要解救被俘虏的人质
A frontal assault is out of the question,正面攻击是不可能的
The keep is well defended when held by a determined enemy and I have not the man-power to attempt it,当敌人坚决防守时，堡垒的防御非常坚固，我没有足够的兵力尝试攻城
There is hope however,但是，还是有希望的
"Hierophant Drahl, shared an ancient legend with me",神圣祭司德拉赫分享了一个古老的传说给我
"When the current temple was constructed, a secret tunnel between it and the keep was reportedly build",当前的神殿建造时，据说在它和堡垒之间建有一条秘密地道
"It served the purpose of allowing the governor in the keep to escape through the temple in case of a siege or, alternatively, it made it possible for the clergy to seek shelter inside the keep if need be",这条地道的用途是在围城时，允许堡垒中的总督通过神殿逃脱，或者在必要时，让神职人员寻求庇护进入堡垒
"Ironically, the tunnel was constructed centuries ago and since Horryn has seen very little warfare, it’s never been used",事实上，这条地道是在几个世纪前建造的，而霍林城很少发生战争，因此它从未被使用过
"In other words, it’s very existence is… less than ensured",换句话说，它的存在……可以说是岌岌可危
Markus offers a sheepish smile,马库斯露出尴尬的微笑
"Nonetheless, at this time the secret tunnel is our best bet",不过，目前秘密地道是我们最好的选择
Hierophant Drahl is waiting for you outside the temple,神圣祭司德拉赫在神殿外等着你
Meet him there and he’ll fill you in,你去见他，他会给你详细说明
"Also, among the refugees returning were Maija and our blacksmith",此外，返回的难民中包括梅亚和我们的铁匠
Both have opened their stores for you if you need to resupply,他们已经打开了店铺，如果你需要补给，可以去那里
And lastly {PLAYER},最后 __PLACEHOLDER_0__

There isn’t much to do!,这里没什么可做的！
They say no ships are coming or going and in any case the region seems far too dangerous for us to venture into for now,据说没有船只来往，而且无论如何，这片地区对我们来说似乎太危险了，不适合我们现在冒险

And don’t worry,别担心

The point is moot,这一点已经无关紧要
We must reach Gradla or perish trying,我们必须到达格拉达，否则只能葬身于此
What is happening here?,这里发生了什么？
I don't understand it!,我不明白！
Then let's get going,那我们就出发吧
"So, ask what you will but mind your surroundings",所以，你问吧，但要注意四周的情况
What’s really going on here Embla?,伊姆拉，这里到底发生了什么？
We should just find a ship and make for the mainland!,我们最好找艘船，直接驶向大陆！
Let's just get going,我们就出发吧
You remembered,你记得了
"Then again, this is like those times back at my father’s villa",再说，这就像在我父亲的别墅里那些时候一样
You chasing me through the maze,你追着我穿过迷宫
Her face darkens,她的脸色变得阴沉
"At least then, we always knew what lay at the center",至少在那时，我们总能知道中心到底是什么
I have so many questions,我有太多问题
#IdraOpenWaters,#IdraOpenWaters
The rise of the Cabal is the surest sign that the power of the Magi-Emperors is waning,卡巴尔的崛起是最明确的迹象，表明魔法皇帝的权力正在衰落
"Even a decade ago, such consolidation of power into lay-hands would be unthinkable",即使十年前，这样的权力集中到世俗手中也是不可想象的
The Cabal is shrouded in secrecy and will go to any lengths to keep it that way,卡巴尔笼罩在秘密之中，他们会不惜一切代价保持这种状态
What few rumors I have heard claim that certain lay-nobles and freelenders are prominent amongst their ranks,我听说的少数谣言声称，某些世俗贵族和平民领主在他们中占据重要地位
Men and women of great wealth and even greater ambition,富有且野心勃勃的男女
"I cannot tell you what their ultimate design is, but these people are no amatuers to power",我无法告诉你他们的最终计划是什么，但这些人对权力绝不是门外汉
They no doubt realize what lies beneath the Priory and the impact its recovery will have on the course of the Empire,他们肯定意识到了修道院下面隐藏的秘密，以及其恢复将对帝国的未来产生怎样的影响
"I also believe that if they were to achieve their end-goal, it would spell disaster for us all",我也相信，如果他们达到了目的，那将对我们所有人都造成灾难性的后果
Enough for today,今天就说到这里吧
We'll talk again later,我们以后再谈
Embla sighs and picks her nails thoughtfully,埃姆拉叹了口气，仔细地修剪着指甲
"The corpse buried underneath the Priory, it… it calls out to me",修道院下面埋着的尸体……它……在召唤我
I cannot tell you exactly when it began but the beckoning intensified greatly once the tomb seals were broken,我不能确切地说出它何时开始的，但是一旦墓室的封印被打破，召唤变得异常强烈
Now it’s almost unbearable and… it’s growing stronger by the day,现在几乎无法忍受，而且……它在一天天变得更强
But why you?,为什么是我？
There are things I’m not ready to talk about,有些事情我还来不及和你讨论
Things from my past - from when we were young together,一些关于我们年轻时的事情——那些被时间尘封的记忆
What I will say is that I sense certain things,我要说的是，我感觉到某些东西
Things that are hidden to most other people,这些东西对大多数人来说都是隐藏的
"Some Magi see them too but I think that, unlike them, I was born with the ability",有些法师也能看到这些，但我认为，与他们不同，我天生就具备这种能力
I believe this is why the corpse calls out to me,我相信这就是尸体召唤我的原因
I'm not sure I understand,我也不确定我是否理解
"To be honest, I’m not sure I understand it myself",实话说，我自己也不完全理解
What I do know is that the calling I feel is real,我知道的是，我感受到的召唤是真实的
Reaching the Priory before the region succumbs to the conjunction is critical,在地区陷入天象之前到达修道院至关重要
"In fact, I fear the survival of the entire Empire hangs on it",事实上，我担心整个帝国的命运都取决于此
I know this and so did the Cabal,我知道这一点，邪教徒也知道
Tell me more about the Cabal!,告诉我更多关于邪教徒的事情！
"When powerful magi pass, their corpses retain much of their reticular attunement",当强大的法师经过时，他们的尸体保留了大部分的网状共鸣
"Emperors are amongst the most powerful of all magi and needless to say, their corpses are a source of great power",皇帝是所有法师中最强大的，不用说，他们的尸体是巨大的力量源泉
It’s not without reason the Imperial Corpses of the Eternity Vale are guarded for so jealously by the Sepulchites,因此，永恒谷的帝国尸体被塞普丘特斯如此严密地守护，绝非偶然
But an Emperor?,但是一位皇帝？
Buried on Gradla?,埋葬在格拉达？
"It sounds incredible, but as I said before, there are corpses from the earlier dynasties that have been lost to history",听起来难以置信，但正如我之前所说，历史上确实有来自早期王朝的遗体失踪了
There were Emperors that were proscribed by the Magi,有一些被法师禁止的皇帝
It may indeed be the corpse of one of these ‘forgotten’ Emperors that has been found on Gradla,这可能是被发现的这些‘被遗忘’皇帝之一的遗体
But there’s more,但还有更多
I'm almost afraid to ask,我几乎不敢问
Latter day Emperors are but a shadow of the rulers of old in terms of power,晚期的皇帝在权力上只是昔日统治者的影子
"If this is truly an Emperor of the Primarian Dynasty, and it has lain undisturbed for all these millennia, the power contained within it will be immense",如果这真的是原生王朝的皇帝，而且它已经沉睡了数千年，其中蕴含的力量将是巨大的
Enough to remake the Empire itself - or topple it utterly,足以重塑帝国本身——或者彻底推翻它
Powerful enough to rend reality itself?,足以撕裂现实本身？
So it seems,看来如此
My belief is that the conjuncture is caused directly by the discovery of the holy corpse,我认为这种结界是由圣洁遗体的发现直接引起的
Its raw power has drawn the attention of ‘that which lingers in darkness’ and now its tentacles are slowly closing in around us,它的原始力量吸引了‘黑暗中徘徊者’的注意，现在它的触手正缓缓向我们逼近
For a moment you think you hear crude chanting in the darkness,你几乎能听到黑暗中粗犷的咒语
It must have been the wind,这一定是风
How do you fit into all of this?,你在这其中扮演什么角色？
Embla leans back and massages her temples,伊姆布拉向后靠，按摩着太阳穴
I’m here for you when you need to talk but I agree,我在这里等你说话，但我同意
Let’s say it’s enough for today,今天就到这里吧
She stands up slowly,她慢慢地站了起来
I’m going to go lie down,我要去躺下
Ship-travel does not agree with me,船行让我感到不适
The ship is alive with nervous energy as the crew scuttles back like pieces of some well-crafted machinery,船上弥漫着紧张的能量，船员们像一些精密机械的零件一样匆忙地来回奔走
"Though your journey is bound to be fraught with danger, there is little doubt that being back at sea has done the crew well",虽然你的旅程注定充满危险，但毫无疑问，重返大海对船员们大有裨益
Not for the monastery itself,不是为了那座修道院本身
But what was said to lie underneath it,但关于它下面隐藏的东西
Embla grasps your wrist and leans in while her voice drops ever so slightly,伊姆布拉抓住你的手腕，凑近你耳边，声音微微压低
The monks built the Priory to guard something,修道士们建造修道院是为了守护某样东西
A grave,一座坟墓
An ancient tomb from the earliest days of the Empire,一座远古的陵墓，来自帝国最古老的年代
"And if the Priory’s existence was truly lost to history, it means that at some point, the very Empire itself must have aided in the conspiracy of silence",如果修道院的存在真的被历史遗忘，这意味着在某个时刻，帝国本身必定参与了沉默的阴谋
But who could be buried there to warrant such extreme measures?,但谁埋在那里，值得采取如此极端的措施？
"I cannot tell you exactly how I know this, but I have not a single shred of doubt",我不能确切告诉你我是怎么知道的，但我一点怀疑都没有
What lies buried under that priory is the corpse of a Magos-Emperor,那座修道院下面埋葬的，是一位魔导皇帝的尸体
"Not only that, but it must be one of the first and oldest of the line",不仅如此，它还必须是这条血脉中最早和最古老的成员之一
That can't be!,不可能！
It can and it is!,可以，而且就是这样！
Not all of the corpses of the first Emperors can be accounted for and interment in the Eternity Vale did not begin until centuries after Gallian’s Ascension,并非所有第一位皇帝的遗体都能被解释和安葬在永恒谷，而永恒谷的安葬仪式直到加利安升天数个世纪之后才开始
The Cabal knew it to be true and as do I,神秘会和我知道这是真的
Their expedition arrived at the island of Gradla a few months ago,他们的探险队几个月前抵达了格拉德拉岛
I suspect they breached the tombs underneath the temple a few weeks later,我怀疑他们在几周后突破了神殿下的陵墓
"Whatever they found there, its reticular reverberations were powerful enough to throw all of the Outer Isles into madness",无论他们在那里发现了什么，其网状回响足以将外群岛推向疯狂
And now we're sailing into the heart of madness?,而我们现在正驶向疯狂的中心？
Embla smiles weakly,埃姆拉勉强笑了笑
He’s calling out to me,他在呼唤我
I feel it in every ounce of my being,我感觉得到，每一寸身体都在回应
"Unfortunately, I’m not the only one to hear the call",不幸的是，不止我一个人听到了召唤
"Like sharks drawn to blood in the water, ‘other’ things are drawn to it as well",就像鲨鱼被水中的血腥吸引，其他东西也被吸引过来
Things from outside,来自外界的东西
Embla swallows hard and her voice drops to a whisper,埃姆拉咽了咽口水，声音低了下来
The Dragon,龙
It’s awakening and its seven eyes are fixed on the Outer Isle,它正在苏醒，它的七眼正盯着外群岛
On the Black Priory!,黑色修道院！
The nearby lanterns flicker,附近的灯笼闪烁起来
Crawling tendrils of madness stretch greedily towards the Priory,狂乱的藤蔓贪婪地向着修道院蔓延
It hungers for the holy corpse and if it reaches it,它渴望着圣洁的遗体，如果它能够触及
"Embla halts, and for a moment struggles to control her breathing",埃姆拉停下了脚步，努力控制着自己的呼吸
You know I’m right,你知道我说的是对的
You can feel it in your guts,你心里清楚
There is no other path out of the Outer Isles except that which leads to the Black Priory and the secrets it holds,除了通往黑修道院及其所藏秘密的道路，外群岛没有其他出路
Embla slumps and sighs,埃姆拉瘫软下来，叹了口气
She looks exhausted and for a moment you see her as the quiet and aloof youngling you once knew,她看起来筋疲力尽，有一瞬间你仿佛看到了曾经那个安静而孤僻的年轻学徒
"True to his idiom, Iago swings in on a rope in dramatic fashion, landing elegantly next to you",确如他所说，伊阿戈以戏剧性的动作从绳索上荡来，优雅地落在你身边
"It is good to feel the wind on our faces, no?",感受着海风拂面，感觉如何？
We are about to leave the fjord and from there we may set our course north towards Gradla,我们即将离开峡湾，从那里我们可以向北航行，前往格拉尔达
Iago scans the horizon ahead,伊阿戈扫描着前方的地平线
The leviathan no doubt stalks us so we must be careful from now on,那头 Leviathan 肯定在跟踪我们，所以我们必须从现在起加倍小心
We must keep to coastal waters and pray to the Maidens that our speed will keep us safe,我们必须沿岸航行，并祈求少女们保佑我们的速度能够确保安全
"Nonetheless, we must take every precaution",不过，我们必须做好一切防范
"For now, I have posted double look-outs and I’ll be manning the helm myself",现在，我已经安排了双倍的瞭望哨，并且我自己也会亲自掌舵
I trust we are in the best of hands,我相信我们正处在最好的保护之下
Indeed you are,的确如此
"{PLAYER}, come see me in my quarters below later if you wish to talk further",{PLACEHOLDER_0}，如果你愿意进一步交谈，稍后可以到我下面的住处来找我
Iago bows and leaves,伊阿戈行了一礼，然后离开了
It is out there,它就在外面
I feel it,我感觉到它了
You turn to see Embla standing behind you,你转身看到艾姆拉站在你身后
The leviathan,海怪
It hungers,它在觅食
I suspect the Deep Ones called it here,我怀疑深海人把它召唤到这里
"Though, who is the master and who is the servant I cannot tell",虽然我不清楚谁是主人，谁是仆人
It is certainly older than them,它肯定比他们古老得多
"You owe me answers, Embla",艾姆拉欠我一个解释
Idra is behind us and I need to know why we’re risking our lives on this fool's errand,伊德拉就在我们身后，我需要知道我们为什么要冒生命危险去做这场愚蠢的任务
I do and now is as good a time as any,我有，现在就是最好的时机
Embla takes you below deck and you find a small corner in the hold that is as close to privacy as can be found on the cramped vessel,艾姆拉带你到船舱下面，你们找到了货舱里一个还算私密的小角落
"She takes a deep breath, as if she is about to plunge into freezing water, and begins talking",她深吸一口气，仿佛要跳入冰冷的水中，然后开始说话
"Two years ago I was, let’s say, put on the trail of a rumor that an expedition had been mounted to the Outer Isles",两年前，我被一条谣言所吸引，据说有一支远征队前往外岛
"More accurately, to an island north of Idra by the name of Gradla",更准确地说，是前往伊德拉北边名为格拉尔达的一座岛屿
It’s a cold and barren place but it is allegedly the location of an ancient monastery referred to as “the Black Priory,那是一个寒冷荒凉的地方，但据说那里有一个名为“黑修道院”的古老修道院
The Black Priory?,黑修道院？
"Though you’ve never heard the name before, it echoes in your mind as if stirring old memories",虽然你从未听说过这个名字，但它在你脑海中回响，仿佛唤醒了旧日的记忆
The site was built a full age into the past and for millennia it stayed unnoticed and far removed from the affairs of the empire,那个地方建于遥远的过去，数千年里一直未被注意，远离帝国的纷争
"So much so, in fact, that it virtually passed out of the historical record centuries ago",事实上，它甚至在几个世纪前几乎从历史记录中消失了
No small feat in an Empire built on the backs of its archivists and record keepers,在一个建立在档案管理员和记录保存者背上的帝国，这并非难事
And thus it would have remained if it wasn’t for the boundless ambition of a group of powerful men known as the Cabal,如果不是因为一个名为“密谋者”的强大团体无尽的野心，它本会如此
I don’t know who it was that whispered in their ear but something convinced them that the Black Priory was not forgotten,我不知道是谁在他们耳边低语，但有件事让他们相信，黑修道院并未被遗忘
It was willfully expunged,它是故意被抹去的
Ask!,询问！
Now is the time,现在正是时候
What if it's the corpse of an Emperor?,如果是帝国皇帝的尸体呢？
What more can you tell me of the Cabal?,你还能告诉我更多关于密谋者的事情吗？
Do you know anything else about the Black Priory?,你知道黑修道院的其他事情吗？
Do we stand a chance at rescuing the people who were taken from Horryn?,我们有没有可能解救从霍林被带走的人们？
I suspect they are already dead… or worse,我怀疑他们已经死了……或者更糟
You lied to Markus?,你欺骗了马库斯？
Would you rather I was as blunt to him as I am to you?,你宁愿我像对你说的一样直接对他吗？
Better they have a sliver of hope,比起绝望，他们更需要一丝希望
There are still trials ahead for Markus and the Horrynites and it would do them no good to face it with a broken heart,对马库斯和霍林人来说，前方仍然有许多考验，让他们带着破碎的心去面对这些考验毫无意义

"You m'lady, are off your rockers",女爵大人，你疯了

The strange construct rises menacingly above you,这个奇怪的机械体高高耸立在你面前，显得十分威吓。
"As you approach, the fungal growths that cling to it writhe in greedy anticipation - clawing impotently at the portal set into the structure’s side",你走近时，附着在其上的菌类生长物在贪婪地扭动，徒劳地抓着结构侧面嵌入的门户。
You cannot easily discern the material used in its construction nor the hands that made it beyond the fact that there is an aspect about it that makes you think of the artifacts that the Magi sometimes employ,你难以轻易分辨出它的构造材料，也难以确定是哪双手制造了它，只是隐约觉得它有一种让人联想到法师有时使用的神器的特质。
"Now, its outer skin is pockmarked and weathered by the shifting of stone over endless millennia",现在，它的外皮布满了坑洼，历经万世石变的侵蚀。

"If you were to guess, you’d say that this machinery somehow attunes and connects the user to Reticular vibrations emanating from the shaft",如果要猜测，你可能会说这些机械装置 somehow 调和并连接使用者与竖井中发出的 Reticular 振动
As to what is generating those vibrations,至于这些振动是由什么产生的

This is the way,这条路是对的

Strewing it in a circle around the summoning focus confines the outsider,在召唤焦点周围撒成一圈，可以限制外来者
Casting the salts upon the outsider utterly unmakes it,将盐撒在外来者身上，会彻底将其摧毁
The salts are difficult to create and may only be crafted in a Protoplasmic Catalyzer,制造这些盐非常困难，只能在原生质催化剂中制作
Three ingredients must be used and added in this precise order,必须使用三种成分，并且按此精确顺序添加
"First, add Sylversalt",首先，加入银盐
"Second, add Salamander’s Horn",其次，加入火蜥蜴角
"Finally, add Lotus Petals",最后，加入莲花花瓣
#WizardDungeonSarcophagus,#法师地下城石棺
You examine the sarcophagus as best you can but fail to make much sense of its purpose beyond it not appearing to be used for burial,你尽可能仔细地检查石棺，但除了它看起来并不用于安葬外，无法理解其用途
Pressing down on the bottom of the interior it appears to give ever so slightly - almost as if it was hinged in some way,按压石棺内部的底部，似乎微微有些下陷——仿佛有些铰链装置
Taking a step back you scan the area around the sarcophagus only to spot a stone tile that is polished almost smooth by years of wear,你退后一步，环视石棺周围，发现一块几乎被岁月磨平的石板
No doubt this is a switch of some sort,毫无疑问，这是一些开关
Press the switch,按下开关
"In the middle of this room stands a large golden sarcophagus-like chest that is richly engraved with complex, arcane-looking symbols",在这个房间中央，矗立着一个大型金色石棺状箱子，表面雕刻着复杂的、看起来很晦涩的符文
Carved in beautiful letters on a lid of the sarcophagus is the following,在石棺盖上用美丽的文字刻着以下内容
"For thy service to thy Lord, Ascension is thy sweet reward",为了你对主的效劳，升天是你甜蜜的奖赏
Open it,打开它
Examine the decorations,检查装饰
The lid of the sarcophagus slides open with surprising ease revealing an interior molded to the form of a human form,棺木的盖子出乎意料地轻松滑开，内部雕刻成人类的形状
"All along the interior walls, more of the strange looking sigils are carved giving the sarcophagus the appearance of being some sort of ‘machine’",内壁上，更多的奇怪符号被雕刻出来，使棺木看起来像某种“机器”
"Carefully pressing down on the switch with your foot, the effect is immediate",踩下开关，效果立刻显现
"The false bottom of the sarcophagus swings to one side, opening up to a shaft below",棺木的假底向一侧滑动，露出下方的通道
"As soon as it does, scorching jets of flame roar up the shaft",一滑动，灼热的火焰喷涌而上，直冲通道
Had someone been laying in the sarcophagus they would have been totally and utterly incinerated,如果有人躺在棺木中，他们会被瞬间焚烧殆尽
Reduces to ash in an instance,立刻化为灰烬
Driina’s eyes go wide with shock,迪莉娜的眼睛睁大了，震惊不已
Is this how those apprentices are repaid for their servitude?,这就是那些学徒为他们的奴役付出的代价吗？
He uses them and then disposes of them like leprous corpses when they can serve no more?,他利用他们，然后像对待麻风病患者一样丢弃他们，当他们不再有用时？
What monster could do such a thing?!,什么样的怪物会做这种事？！
You shudder at the implication,你对这种暗示感到寒毛直竖
How many of this man’s ‘apprentices’ have ended their life in this way?,这个男人的“学徒”中有多少人以这种方式结束了自己的生命？
The symbols carved into the sarcophagus appear to be magical in nature,刻在棺木上的符号看起来具有魔法性质
"Beyond that however, you have no idea of their meaning or purpose",但是，你对它们的意义或目的一无所知
"At first glance, the symbols carved into the sarcophagus appear to be magical in nature",初看上去，刻在棺木上的符号看起来具有魔法性质
"This however, is only at first glance",但这只是初看上去
Further examination reveals that they are nothing but purely decorative patterns of no arcane significance,进一步检查后发现，它们只是纯粹的装饰图案，没有任何神秘意义
"In fact, you feel certain that the gold-leaf covering the structure is fake as well",实际上，你确信覆盖在结构上的金箔也是假的
#WizardDungeonSummoningChamber1,#法师地牢召唤室1
Howling winds scream through these halls,咆哮的风声在这些走廊中呼啸
Though you feel it clawing at your exposed skin there is something strange about it,尽管你感觉到它在抓挠你裸露的皮肤，但有些奇怪的地方
A ghost wind,一种幽风
Only partially of the material world,只是部分存在于物质世界
The other half coming from beyond,另一半来自彼岸
No doubt Calipero’s summoning chamber lies ahead,毫无疑问，卡拉佩罗的召唤室就在前方
#WizardDungeonSummoningChamberFinal,#法师地牢召唤室最终
You fling the vial of salt at the horrid creature but a gust of that terrible witch-wind catches the bottle instead,你将装有食盐的瓶子扔向那可怖的生物，但一阵可怕的女巫风却将瓶子吹偏了
It misses its mark and shatters against the wall and the Salts of Elthanyr spread into the roiling vortex,它偏离了目标，撞在墙上摔碎了，埃尔坦尼尔的食盐洒进了翻滚的漩涡中
Each grain that strikes the pillar of smokes explodes into a tiny shower of sparks but it does not have the intended effect,每一粒击中烟柱的食盐都化作了一小簇火花，但并没有达到预期的效果
Instead something roars in the beyond and in an explosion of white light Calipero’s ward collapses,反而，从彼岸传来一声咆哮，伴随着一阵白光，卡拉佩罗的防护阵塌陷了
You have failed your quest,你已经失败了
The howling witch-winds rise as you push south into what must be the summoning chamber,咆哮的女巫风随着你向南推进，进入了必定是召唤室的地方
Emerging from the central pool is a great whirling plume of black smoke,从中央的水池中升起了一股巨大的旋涡黑烟
"Bluish light flashes inside it like lightning and, for a few mercifully brief moments, illuminates something vast swimming inside the smoke",黑烟中闪现出蓝色的光芒，像闪电一样，照亮了烟雾中某种巨大生物的轮廓，持续了几秒钟
"The thing claws at the threshold of reality, desperate to break through - like a drowning man trapped under the thinnest of ice-sheets",那东西在现实的边缘抓挠，渴望突破——就像一个溺水的人被困在薄冰之下
Standing in front of the hideous thing is a single robed human figure,那可怖的东西面前站着一个身穿长袍的人类身影
"You fling the vial at the pillar of black smoke and watch in awe as the salt ignites, turning the pillar from a pillar of smoke to a pillar of multi-colored flame instead",你将瓶子扔向那团黑烟，惊叹地看到食盐点燃了，黑烟柱变成了多色火焰
Calipero no doubt,卡拉佩罗无疑
"Encased in some glimmering sphere of force, Calipero’s form is utterly frozen in time",被某种闪烁的力场包裹，卡拉佩罗的身形完全被冻结在时间之中
"Nonetheless, his statue-like form conveys superhuman effort",然而，他的石像般的身形传达出超人的努力
He has held the monstrosity from beyond at bay this long but his grip is no doubt failing,他一直将那来自异界的怪物挡在远处，但他的力量无疑正在衰竭
Throw the salt at the pillar of smoke,把盐扔向那团烟柱
The man who stands before you looks much like his apprentices,站在你面前的男人和他的学徒看起来很像
Or perhaps it is more accurate to say they look a lot like him for no doubt this is the original,或者更准确地说，他们看起来很像他，因为毫无疑问，这正是原本的主人
"He regards you with cold eyes, head slightly cocked to one side, but says nothing",他用冰冷的眼神注视着你，头微微侧向一边，但却什么也没说
You open your mouth to speak and he snaps his fingers,你张开嘴准备说话，他却啪地一拍手指
A rush of air and sudden vertigo and then you are somewhere else,一阵空气的涌动和突然的眩晕，然后你出现在了另一个地方
A man dressed in the colorful garb of a traveling theater performer walks onto the stage and the crowd falls utterly silent,一个穿着旅行剧团服饰的男人走上舞台，观众们顿时陷入了沉默
Something screams in terror from beyond,超越时空的恐惧尖叫传来
At first the roar of some great beast then the whimper of a child,先是一声巨大的野兽咆哮，接着是一个孩子的啜泣
"Then, suddenly, all is quiet and the thing is no more",然后，突然之间，一切都变得寂静，那东西也不复存在
You reel from the shock of the unmaking and for a moment your vision is obscured by the bright afterimages of the arcane light,你被解体的冲击弄得摇摇晃晃，片刻间，你的视野被法术光芒的明亮后影所遮蔽
"Slowly, your eyesight readjusts to the now darkened chamber and you see the Magos rising slowly to his feet",慢慢地，你的视力重新适应了现在黑暗的房间，你看到魔导士缓缓站起身来
Calipero I presume?,卡拉佩罗是吧？
#WizardsTowerEnter,#进入法师塔
You mind reels as you look around the lush interior of the tower,你惊愕地环顾四周，法师塔的内部装饰得如此繁复
"Colorful, fragrant flowers abound and exotic songbirds sing in every bush",彩色的、芬芳的花朵随处可见，奇异的鸣鸟在每棵灌木丛中歌唱
"Stranger still, the tower’s interior is somehow much larger than its exterior seems to allow",更加奇怪的是，这座塔的内部空间似乎比外部看起来要大得多
Kat looks around in awe,卡特惊叹地环视四周
This place is… impossible,这个地方……是不可能的
I wonder what hands could have shaped such beauty?,想必是某个术士的作品吧？
"No doubt this is the work of some Magos, yes?",毫无疑问，这一定是某个术士的作品
Let’s not be blinded by the splendor,别被这些华丽所迷惑
Iben muses as he carefully prods at one of the orchids with his weapon,伊本一边仔细用武器触碰其中一朵兰花，一边沉思
"Looking around, You cannot help but wonder what hands could have shaped such beauty",四处看看，你不禁会想，是什么双手塑造了如此之美
#WizardTowerQuestBegin,#巫师塔任务开始
Embla strokes her chin,埃姆拉摸了摸下巴
The scent of the Reticulum is about this,这里弥漫着瑞提库姆的香气
I would wager much that this ‘Master’ he speaks of is a sorcerer of sorts,我敢打赌，他所说的‘大师’大概是个术士
A Magos even,甚至是个术士
"Though time is against us, another Magos could be a powerful ally and our path to Gradla takes us past Eryll in any case",虽然时间紧迫，但另一个术士可以成为强大的盟友，而且我们的道路将带我们经过厄里尔
"I say, we should at least investigate this further",我说，我们至少应该进一步调查一下
Let's be on our way for now,我们现在就出发吧
"From his skin and nails to his jaundiced eyes and missing teeth, this young man appears to have been stricken by some disease",从皮肤和指甲到黄疸的眼睛和缺失的牙齿，这个年轻人似乎被某种疾病所困扰
"Beyond that, you’ve never seen anything quite like it and have no idea how to classify it",除此之外，你从未见过这种东西，也不知道该如何分类
"So, what is this about your master then?",那么，你所说的‘大师’是关于什么呢？
"From his skin and nails to his jaundiced eyes and missing teeth, the young man’s condition is perplexing",从皮肤和指甲到黄疸的眼睛和缺失的牙齿，这个年轻人的情况令人费解
Some of these symptoms are similar to those suffered by Magi upon exposure to strong magics over time but this is far too severe - especially considering the man’s young age,其中一些症状与术士长期接触强大法术后所遭受的症状相似，但这种情况太过严重，尤其是考虑到这个年轻人的年龄
It’s as if he’s quite literally falling apart in front of your eyes,仿佛他真的在你眼前分崩离析
"Strangest of all, it appears as if the man is oblivious to his condition",最为奇怪的是，这个男人似乎完全不知道自己的状况
That is why you are travelling to the Black Priory,这就是你前往黑修道院的原因
"His tattered robes, bald head and unhealthy pallor reminds you of a magos, though this boy is surely too young?",他破旧的长袍、光秃的头和病态的肤色让你想起了一个魔导士，但这个男孩显然太年轻了？
He follows your passing with an idiotic smile draped over his round bland face,他带着愚蠢的笑容，圆而平淡的脸上跟着你走
Can I help you?,你需要帮助吗？
Ignore the man,忽略这个男人
We have come,我们来了
he stops for a long moment and thinks,他停下了脚步，沉思了一会儿
to beg for aid!,求助！
Our Master is missing down below and we are not allowed to enter and search for him,我们的主人在下面失踪了，我们被禁止进入寻找他
Something is wrong - we know it!,有什么不对劲的地方——我们能感觉到
"A note of agitation, bordering on panic, creeps into his voice",他的声音中带着一丝焦躁，几乎接近恐慌
"Suddenly he stops, choughs slightly, and then smiles again",突然，他停了下来，咳嗽了一下，然后再次笑了
Bloody drool runs down his chin along with one of the man’s teeth,他嘴边流下血污的唾液，还有一颗牙齿
What of your master?,你们的主人怎么样？
Help!,帮助！
the young man croaks as you pass him,这个年轻人在你经过时嘶哑地喊道
He blinks as if he was equally surprised as you at the outburst - all the while smiling moronically,他眨了眨眼睛，显然和你一样被这突然的喊叫惊呆了——同时愚蠢地笑着
Well!,好吧！
Speak up boy or you’ll get the back of my hand!,少废话，小子，不然我可要用我的手掌教训你了！

Find us there and learn of our Master’s fate,去那里找我们，并了解我们主人的下落
"But please, time is of the essence and for each second you tarry, hope fades",但请，时间紧迫，你每拖延一秒，希望就会淡一分
"The words flow as if rehearsed and then, as he speaks the last words he lets out a deep sigh and sits down on the ground",话语流畅得仿佛事先排练过，说完最后一句话后，他深深地叹了口气，坐在地上
Eryll?,厄里尔？

You’re not well at all,你根本不好
she mumbles to herself,她自言自语道

Find us there,他重复道，然后声音渐渐消失
he repeats before his voice trails off,他重复道，然后声音渐渐消失
Fool’s mind is gone,这家伙已经疯了
He’ll be food for crows come nightfall and it’ll be a mercy,夜幕降临时，他将成为乌鸦的食物，那将是一种慈悲
Roland mumbles,洛兰嘟囔着
Are you just going to sit there?,你只是打算坐在那里吗？
The man rolls over on his side - eyes staring stiffly ahead,那人翻了个身，眼睛僵硬地盯着前方
"Though he still appears to be alive, no prodding or prompting raises any kind of response from him",尽管他似乎仍然活着，但任何刺激或提示都无法引起任何反应
There appears to be nothing more you can do for this lost soul save consider his request,对于这个失魂落魄的灵魂，除了考虑他的请求，似乎别无他法

You emerge into what appears to be an observatory of sorts,你来到了一个类似天文台的地方
Astronomical glyphs cover the floor and in the center of the room stands what appears to be a huge telescope,天文符号覆盖了整个地面，房间中央矗立着一个巨大的望远镜。
"Strangely though, there does not appear to be any form of aperture in the roof that would allow it to observe the sky",令人奇怪的是，屋顶上并没有任何观察天空的开口。
Four robed figures huddle together under the strange construct like frightened animals,四个穿着长袍的身影像受惊的动物一样挤在那个奇怪的装置下。
Come out so I can see you!,出来，让我看看你们！
Slowly the four figures creep forwards into the half-light and to your astonishment you see that all four have identical faces,四个身影缓缓向前移动，进入了半明半暗之中，你惊讶地发现他们四人的面孔竟然完全相同。
Indeed they all appear to be identical to the strange man you met on Idra,确实，他们全都与你在伊德拉遇到的那个暴风雨般的师傅一模一样。
You come for Master!,你们是来见大师的！
"one of the men states, rather than asks, with a serene smile on his face",其中一人面带平和的微笑，而不是询问地说道。
What in the Magi’s Loins is going on here?,这里到底在搞什么鬼？
